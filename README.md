## This is a basic and ridiculous setup of a simulation environment build 
if you would like to run this in browser pase this into your browser
```
docgould.github.io
```
## If you want to run it offline, and see what I did on your own computer
 - [ ] Download the Git
 - [ ] run this command from a terminal in the docgould.githib.io/<root> directory

```
python3 -m http.server
```
it should give you the option to click on it I believe ;)
